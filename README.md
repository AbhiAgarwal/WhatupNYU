WhatupNYU
=========

WhatupNYU is an aggregator for all of NYU's social media (NYUSecrets, etc.). It was created as part of a mini-hackathon and built for the sole purpose of providing a single access point for all of NYU's media services.

The version is currently the older one as the newer service (with NYULocal, and People) got deleted when the server died, but it contains the same basic things behind it.

It's not cache optimized (like the new one was), but just takes data directly from Facebook. I will be adding some more functionality after I recover & reprogram some of the things.

My thoughts on creating it:
